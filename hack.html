What decisions are these cars making — such as stopping (or not stopping) when a pedestrian is crossing the road, or how an autonomous car behaves to avoid a collision — and do drivers think they're ethical?
To  improve future technologies and guide autonomous vehicles so they make decisions we all agree are safe, acceptable, and permissible. </p>
<br>
To design an easy-to-use interface so that the drivers can rate their autonomous vehicles.

<p style="font-size: 18px" >
	As a team, we brainstormed to find out the challenges a driver may face to give a car a positive and negative feedback after it performs any action.The challenges we listed:<br>
<ol>
	<li>What is the best possible way to give feedback?</li>
	<li>How to optimize the number of responses given by the driver?</li>
</ol><p style="font-size: 18px" >
 Also, we realized that it is important to give a reason to the car for every feedback, so that the car can learn if a particular action is suitable in a particular context.

                                 </p>

                                  <p style="font-size: 18px">The challenge was to design a user interface for drivers through which they can give feedback for vehicle's action and which can be fed to the machine learning algorithm. Our main aim was to take user's feedback in the least intrusive way possible. This was to ensure that the user doesn't get frustrated while giving feedback. This would maximize the number of feedback and help the vehicle learn even more.</p> 
                                  <p><br>
                                  	<b>How does the learning algorithm work?</b><br>
                                  	The learning algorithm that was given as a part of the challenge learned through evaluative reinforcement. On every action, a manual feedback was given to the agent. The agent will keep on learning through these feedbacks. The evaluative responses can be positive or negative. <br>


                                  	<b>How does our system work?</b><br>
                                  	The system will keep receiving user feedback through different sources. It will associate the feedback (positive or negative) with the action taken by the vehicle and help it learn the 'preferences' of its driver.
                                  </p><br>


                                 <p>Our system comprised of the following elements:
                                 		<p>
                                 			<b>1. Voice Recognition Model :</b><br>
                                 			This would take input of the driver's verbal comments. This would also take into account user's involuntary verbal expressions and interpret them as positive or negative.
                                 		</p>
                                 		<br>
                                 			<p>
                                 			<b>2. Facial Recognition Model :</b><br>
                                 			This would take input of the driver's facial expressions and interpret them as positive or negative.
                                 		</p>
                                 		<br>
                                 		<p>
                                 			<b>3. Wearable Devices :</b><br>
                                 			Input from wearable devices like smart watches can provide an insight on how the body of the driver reacts to a situation. These reactions can be interpreted. For example- if in a situation the heart rate of the driver increases rapidly, it can be interpreted as a negative feedback.
                                 		</p><br>
                                 		<p>
                                 			<b>4. Voluntary User Feedback:</b><br>
                                 			The driver can provide a feedback voluntarily through a mobile application. The UI design of this application is the main focus of the rest of this project.
                                 		</p>
                                 		<br>


                                 		<p>Fedbacks from above sources will be fed to the machine learning algorithm. Based on them, the algorithm and hence the vehicle will learn the actions preferred by the user. Eventually, it will learn the social norms of that society.</p>

-What information do they consume from TxDOT?<br> -What do the users think of TxDOT?<br>
-What information do they expect from TxDOT? <br>-What are their news consumption habits?<br>
I did the following to generate numerical facts:<br>
-Analysed data from Google trends.<br>
-Conducted a survey and analyzed data from 300+ responses.</p>

<p> Google Trends is a website by Google that analyzes the popularity of top search queries in Google Search across various regions and languages. The website uses graphs to compare the search volume of different queries over time.<br>
The following graph shows the search query “Texas Department of Transportation” on Google in Texas over the past 12 months.</p>

                                	</div><p>TxDOT was most searched during the time period between Jan 14 and Jan 20 2018. On researching further for the cause of this surge, I found out that it was due to inclement weather in Texas during that time.
On running the same analysis for California Department of Transportation, I discovered similar trends.</p>
  <p style="color: #E49F2E"><b>Key Finding</b><br></p>
<p> This proves that people only look up TxDot only when they have a specific purpose in mind.</p>


  <p style="color: #E49F2E"><b>Survey</b><br></p>
  <p>An online survey was conducted to find out the following about Texas Drivers:<br>
- Driving habits<br>
- Usage of different media for accessing information - Preference of type of content<br>
- Perception of TxDOT<br>
- Expectations from TxDOT<br>
The survey generated 311 responses in total. Out of the total respondents 70% were females and 30% were males
  </p>  <p style="color: #E49F2E"><b>Key Finding</b><br></p>
  <p>
  	1. When asked which electronic device do they use regulary, the most popular answer was Mobile Phone.<br>

  </p>

  <p style="color: #157773"><b>Qualitative Research</b><br></p>
  <p>To dive deeper and measure an objective reality that exists externally from the researcher, I conducted qualitative research with my classmates.<br>
  	1. Together we interviewed 11 people and asked them about their news consumption and driving habits and their thoughts on TxDOT.<br>
  	2. Made them navigate through TxDOT’s website and observed them.<br>
  	<br><br>Users' responses while navigating through:
  		<div class="one margin-0">
   		<img src="demo-images/ql1.png" alt="" />
        </div>
  <p style="color: #157773"><b>Key Finding</b><br></p>
  <p>Created a journey map to realized their habits deeply and search for oppo!unity areas which can be leveraged. </p>
<div class="one margin-0">
   		<img src="demo-images/ql2.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>- Although people want to know about construction projects but 7 out of 11 people we interviewed never check that online before planning any trip. They believe word of mouth for it. This maybe because of absence of easily accessible source maybe because they don’t care enough for it.<br>
- The website’s architecture and visual elements make it difficult for the users to navigate through the website.<br>
- People don’t understand what TxDOT does even after visiting their website.</p>


  <p style="color: #DA784D"><b>Recommendations</b><br></p>
  <b>1. People want to know what TxDot does.</b><br>
TxDot should tell positive stories of what it does and how it contributes to the
society. Few pressing topics could be: Fund utilizations, Current and Future Projects and their timeline, how it is different thatn TxDPS and DMV.<br>
<b>2. Make TxDOT’s website more usable and include more multimedia elements.</b><br>
-Use of media other than text.<br>
-The search function should be highlighted.<br>
-Inclusion of Quick Links and FAQs based on web analytics result.<br> -Use of less technical jargons.<br>
-Menu choices ahould be minimized.<br>
<b>3.Leverage DriveTexas and make a holistic web application for TxDOT.</b><br>
- Use of mobile devices for news consumption continues to grow.<br>
-The app can serve all the demands of users on the go.<br> - Traffic, Weather,
Roadways Projects.<br>
-People want to know about road construction but they don’t usually look for it
before starting a road trip. This gap can be bridged.<br>
<b>4. Media should not be replaced.</b><br>
Media engagement is essdential for survival of a successful media center so TxDOT should be media friendly.<br>
<b>5. Leverage Social Media and prioritize Facebook.</b><br>
TxDOT is doing a fair job at posting information on social media platforms. If it wants to leverage it more content can be made more tailored to people’s needs as discussed earlier.
Even though TxDOT does a lot of things similar to its competitors, people only visit txdot for specific reasons. It s not wrong to say that there is no urgency for a comprehensive newsroom.
If TxDOT is in a situation where it has to prioritize between different social media platforms, it should opt Facebook as users comment and share more stories on it than any other platform.<br>
<b>6. Utilize radio as a medium.</b><br>
Radio is the only medium which hasn’t seen substantial decline in the users, TxDOT can push its stories through radio.<br>
<b>7. Launch a podcast.</b><br>
Another trending way to push stories is through podcasts. After adopting above solutions, TxDOT can try launching podcasts if it is feasible for the media center team.
